## System Requirements

### Hardware

- Windows Operating System (Windows 10 or higher recommended)
- At least 4GB RAM and 1GB free disk space

### Software

- PowerShell 7+ (Required for `FileUploadScript.ps1`)
- Administrator permissions to run PowerShell scripts
- Internet connection for API calls to SailPoint
- Java Runtime Environment (JRE) version 11 or later
- [ImportExcel PowerShell Module](https://github.com/dfinke/ImportExcel) (Automatically installed by the script if not already installed)

### Files Required

- `DirectoryCreateScript.ps1` (for initial setup)
- `settings.json` (created during setup by the Directory Creation script)
- `FileUploadScript.ps1` (for data processing and SailPoint uploads)
- `config.json` (required for each app folder)

---

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Run the Directory Creation Script

1. Open PowerShell as Administrator.
2. Navigate to the directory where `DirectoryCreateScript.ps1` is saved.
3. Execute the script:

   ```powershell
   .\DirectoryCreateScript.ps1
   ```

4. Follow the on-screen prompts to configure settings.

### Step 2: Verify Settings

- After the script runs, a `settings.json` file is created in the script's directory.
- Open `settings.json` to confirm the details are correct. Example `settings.json`:

   ```json
   {
       "ParentDirectory": "C:\Powershell\FileUploadUtility",
       "AppFolder": "C:\Powershell\FileUploadUtility\Import",
       "FileUploadUtility": "C:\Powershell\sailpoint-file-upload-utility-4.1.0.jar",
       "ClientSecret": "YourSecretHere",
       "ClientID": "YourClientIDHere",
       "tenant": "YourTenantHere",
       "isDebug": false
   }
   ```

## Running the File Upload Script

### Manual Execution

1. Open PowerShell and navigate to the directory where `FileUploadScript.ps1` is located.
2. Run the script:

   ```powershell
   .\FileUploadScript.ps1
   ```

---

## Task Scheduler Setup

### Step 1: Open Task Scheduler

1. Press `Win + R`, type `taskschd.msc`, and press Enter.
2. Create a new task and configure it as follows:

### Step 2: Configure General Settings

- **Name**: SailPoint File Upload
- **Run whether user is logged on or not**
- **Run with highest privileges**

### Step 3: Configure Triggers

- Set the frequency (e.g., Daily, Weekly) and start time.

### Step 4: Configure Actions

- **Program/script**: `powershell.exe`
- **Arguments**: `-File "C:\Path\To\FileUploadScript.ps1"`

### Step 5: Configure Conditions

- Uncheck `Start the task only if the computer is on AC power` to allow the task to run on battery power.

### Step 6: Save and Test

1. Save the task.
2. Test the task by right-clicking it in Task Scheduler and selecting **Run**.

## Config.json Structure

Each app folder must contain a `config.json` file to define the file processing and upload behavior.

### Example Config.json

```json
{
    "sourceID": "12345",
    "isMonarch": false,
    "disableField": "Status",
    "disableValue": ["Inactive", "Disabled"],
    "groupTypes": "Group,Department",
    "groupDelimiter": ",",
    "isUpload": true,
    "headerRow": 1,
    "trimTopRows": 2,
    "trimBottomRows": 0,
    "trimLeftColumns": 1,
    "trimRightColumns": 0,
    "dropColumns": "Column1,Column2",
    "columnsToMerge": "FirstName,LastName",
    "mergedColumnName": "FullName",
    "adminColumnName": "Role",
    "adminColumnValue": "Admin"
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Settings Not Saved

- Ensure the `DirectoryCreateScript.ps1` was run as Administrator.

### Missing ImportExcel Module

- Ensure you have an internet connection and permission to install PowerShell modules.
